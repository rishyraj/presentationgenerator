Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth upon this continent a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal know we are engaged in a great civil war testing whether that Nation or any Nation so conceived and so dedicated can long and deer we are met on a great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of it as a final resting place for those who have died here that the nation might live this we met and all propriety to but in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground the brave men living and dead who struggled here have hollowed it far above our poor power to add or detract the world will little note nor long. Remember what we say here while it can never forget what they did here.
